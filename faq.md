### Q: What is Vortex Gallery?

A: Vortex Gallery is a series of events run by the collaboration of a group of volunteer tournament organizers, streamers, bracket runners, chat mods, and commentators at several major fighting game events in North America, or online as its own separate event.

### Q: Why isn’t [Insert Game Here] at Vortex Gallery?

A: Short answer: Because you are not running it.

Long answer: Vortex Gallery tournaments are hosted on a volunteer basis. Every year, we accept submissions from volunteers who are dedicated & experienced in running side tournaments for their respective games. If a game isn’t being run at Vortex Gallery, it’s because no one stepped up to dedicate their time, money & effort to contact us and run it. We welcome any and all competitive games (not just fighting!) to be a part of Vortex Gallery.

### Q: How can I help out?

A: For TO, Streaming, Commentator & Equipment volunteers, check out our volunteer page or check the [@956Productions Twitter account](https://twitter.com/956productions) for the volunteer form link we normally drop before we announce our initial line up. For other inquiries, please send a DM to @956Productions or email us at info (at) 956 (dot) productions.

Sometimes we get volunteer submissions from people who are passionate about their game, but are perhaps not experienced enough to manage the complexity involved in running a tournament at the “largest and longest-running fighting game tournaments in the world” that is Evo, Frosty Faustings, or on the scale we tend to run our online events, which are one of the biggest in the community. We encourage these hopefuls to reach out to their communities to find people with more experience in running side-tournaments at majors, and to assist them at Vortex Gallery to learn the ropes, and perhaps take the reins in the future.
