Vortex Gallery is run by volunteers who commit their time and dedication to help plan, produce and ultimately run many of the official, and un-official tournaments throughout the year at events all across the FGC.

Vortex Gallery is managed by <a href="https://twitter.com/956productions">956 Productions</a>, a small team of experienced Event Organizers who seek to provide a stage & spotlight for underrepresented games!

The Vortex Gallery lineup is built by and for the community, we are seeking volunteers to take the lead on their favorite games and others to help report scores and commentate streams. Basically, if you're down to help out, we could use you on the squad!
